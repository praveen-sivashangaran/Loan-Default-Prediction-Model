* The LendingClub dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle.
* LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company and the dataset contains historical data on loans given out in the past. 
* The objective of this project is to build a model that is capable of predicting if a potential borrower will pay back their loan.
